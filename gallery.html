                <p style="font-size: large;">Home minister Amit Shah said the decision made by Prime Minister Narendra

                    Hatya Diwas to mark the imposition of the Emergency. <br><br> The Indira Gandhi-led Congress
                    government

                <h3>Which Democrats Have Called for Biden to Drop Out of the Race?</h3>
                <p>The angst among Democrats over President Biden’s debate performance is intensifying, with some party
                    members voicing concern about his candidacy and some others urging him to withdraw. At least a
                    half-dozen top House Democrats have also reportedly told colleagues privately that Mr. Biden should
                    end his candidacy. A growing number of donors and business leaders have added to the pressure by
                    calling on Mr. Biden to drop out, with some threatening to withhold dollars.

                    The situation is threatening to divide the party ahead of its national convention next month in
                    Chicago, where Mr. Biden is scheduled to accept the Democratic nomination. Here is what Democratic
                    politicians have said so far.</p>

                    World Cup and retaining the Ashes in England, he couldn't get his hands on the IPL trophy as well

                    Ambani's wedding</h3>
                <p>Wrestler-turned-actor John was greeted with excitement as he arrived in Mumbai on Friday afternoon.
                    Wearing a grey tee shirt, tan shorts, and a cap, he smiled as he spotted the paparazzi clicking him
                    and yelling out his name. The desi paparazzi were back with their ‘Jhendaya’ antics (Who can forget
                    the hilarity that ensued during the NMACC launch?), calling out for ‘John babu’ and ‘John kaka’.
                    After thanking his posse, he waved at the photographers before getting into his car, adding to the
                    buzz around the event.</p>

                <h3>Delhi court extends Arvind Kejriwal’s judicial custody till July 25 in case registered by CBI</h3>
                <p>Delhi's Rouse Avenue court extended the judicial custody of chief minister Arvind Kejriwal until July
                    25 in a case registered by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) against him in the excise
                    policy case.


                    The CBI has accused Kejriwal of being ‘one of the main conspirators’ in the irregularities linked to
                    the now-scrapped Delhi excise policy. <br>In its previous chargesheet, the CBI had
                    claimed that out of ₹100 crore kickbacks received by AAP, an amount of ₹44.45 crore was transferred
                    to Goa during June 2021 to January 2022 via ‘hawala channels’, and was used for AAP's assembly poll
                    campaign in the coastal state.

                <p>The Delhi BJP protested at the Secretariat on Friday against the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government’s
                    “price hike” of electricity bills, alleging that AAP-supported discoms were charging consumers hefty
                    amounts under the guise of power purchase adjustment charge (PPAC).

                <p>The Academy posted a hilarious scene that takes place in the exam hall when Aamir Khan's Rancho,
                    Sharman Joshi's Raju and R Madhavan's Farhan rush to write their exam papers half an hour late. They
                    keep on writing even when the time is up for the exam, much to the disgust of the invigilator. He
                    then says that neither of their papers would be accepted as they were late. But Rancho takes his
                    answer sheet, along with Farhan and Raju's, and mixes them with the hundreds of other answer sheets
                    and runs away!</p>

                <h3>Mona Singh: Movies nowadays shouldn’t be about looking good, content is king</h3>
                <p>In an era where captivating audiences is no easy feat, Mona Singh says the recent success of the
                    horror-comedy film Munjya underscores a fundamental truth: content is king. The actor, who has
                    garnered praise for her role in the Maharashtrian folk-inspired tale, tells us that the allure of
                    flashy blockbusters is fading in favour of rich storytelling.

                    Mona Singh was last seen in Munjya

                    “It’s not the hero or flashy massy films that attract the audience to theatres now, but its actually
                    the content that plays an important role,” Singh asserts. “Movies nowadays shouldn’t just be about
                    looking good, making some hit song, and shooting at great locations, it should be about great
                    content and experience.”</p>
